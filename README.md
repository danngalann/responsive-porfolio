# Responsive Porfolio
A simple responsive portfolio made for practice purposes. Made with the help of [Brad Traversy](https://github.com/bradtraversy)'s [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLillGF-RfqbYoGoCjKoMOkVznV6aSXKzU).

## What I've learned
With this project I learned a bit about using JS in an actual website, but the most interesting part has been learning about SASS's code,  workflow and best practices, as well as having an organized structure to the entire project.
